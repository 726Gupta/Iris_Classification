# Iris_Classification
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using a supervised machine learning approach. The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Project Overview

The project involves:

Data preprocessing to ensure clean and usable inputs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into the dataset.

Building, training, and evaluating classification models.

Comparing model performances to select the best-performing model.

Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset contains:

Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width

Target: Iris Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Preprocessing Steps

Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.

Normalization: Applied normalization to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

Train-Test Split: Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots.

Analyzed feature correlations to understand relationships within the data.

Identified key features contributing to classification.
